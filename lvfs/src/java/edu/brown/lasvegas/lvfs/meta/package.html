  Provides metadata repository to maintain all metadata in LVFS.
  This package is the core implementation and
  does NOT provide the way to access the repository
  from remote client or local application on Hadoop.

  In other words, classes in this package are agnostic to
  the application container. They can work both in local
  application and in Hadoop namenode.
